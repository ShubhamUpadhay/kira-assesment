Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.'})]}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:I.a.fournews,children:[Object(p.jsx)("h1",{children:"Where can I get some?"}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."})]}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:I.a.fournews,children:[Object(p.jsx)("h1",{children:"Why do we use it?"}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:"It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."})]})]}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:I.a.lastnews,children:[Object(p.jsx)("h3",{children:"The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s"}),Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:'"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."'})]})]})},A=function(){var e=Object(n.useState)([]),t=Object(c.a)(e,2),a=t[0],s=t[1];return Object(n.useEffect)((function(){return s(v)}),[]),Object(p.jsx)("div",{className:"mainDiv",children:Object(p.jsxs)(u.a,{children:[Object(p.jsx)(w,{}),Object(p.jsxs)(d.c,{children:[Object(p.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/about",component:W}),Object(p.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/contact",component:b}),Object(p.jsx)(d.a,{path:"/product",component:T}),Object(p.jsx)("div",{className:"newsDiv",children:a.map((function(e){return Object(p.jsx)(E,Object(l.a)({},e))}))})]}),Object(p.jsx)(j,{})]})})},E=function(e){var t=e.author,a=e.title,n=e.description,s=e.url,i=e.urlToImage,r=e.publishedAt,o=e.content;return Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"newsTab",children:[Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"imgholder",children:[Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"imgDiv",children:[" ",Object(p.jsx)("img",{src:i})]}),Object(p.jsx)("span",{children:t}),Object(p.jsx)("span",{children:r})]}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"headingHolder",children:[Object(p.jsx)("h2",{children:a}),Object(p.jsx)("h4",{children:n})]}),Object(p.jsxs)("div",{className:"contentHolder",children:[Object(p.jsx)("p",{children:o}),Object(p.jsx)("button",{onClick:function(){return window.open(s)},children:"Learn More"})]})]})};r.a.render(Object(p.jsx)(s.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(p.jsx)(A,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),o()},5:function(e,t,a){e.exports={mainDiv:"about_mainDiv__3t3hK",head:"about_head__3aXTg",fournewsContainer:"about_fournewsContainer__24X-b",fournews:"about_fournews__axcVS",lastnews:"about_lastnews__2CbWj",mainHeading:"about_mainHeading__nB6XZ"}},8:function(e,t,a){e.exports={main:"product_main__3b9dg",tableDiv:"product_tableDiv__3sylA",BtnDiv:"product_BtnDiv__1Hv4R",naviDiv:"product_naviDiv__lFakC",thead:"product_thead__3sr-9"}},9:function(e,t,a){e.exports={nav:"header_nav__2APR3",menu:"header_menu__3g4tx",company:"header_company__5dHZi",menuItem:"header_menuItem__dKnWr"}}},[[38,1,2]]]);
